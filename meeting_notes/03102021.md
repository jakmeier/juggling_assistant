# Meeting notes Sunday 3rd of October

* Mediapipe good for more advanced techniques, e.g. "Pose"
* Tracking on its own works fine with just OpenCV but very error prone to backgrounds with similar color to the ball (maybe we can fix this with a physical model / pose model)

## Outlook
* Until next time, new video with only white background
* Installation on Valentin's PC
* Topic next time: Define object tracking output for next phase and try to use it
