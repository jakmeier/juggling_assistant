# Meeting notes 17.10

- Object tracking sometimes works pretty well
- basic architecture started
- played around with apples

## Outlook

- Data export would be handy (and corresponding import)
- automate detection somehow
- Think about model for filtering path
- How should the `ball_path` look when we do it properly?
  - deal with multiple balls?
  - deal with time instead of frame numbers
- Statistics after run:
  - number of throws -> how to filter this?
  - consistency of height
- Regarding statistics: what to do online, what offline?
